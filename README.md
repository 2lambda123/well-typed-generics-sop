A library to support the definition of generic functions.
Datatypes are viewed in a uniform, structured way: the choice
way: the choice between constructors is represented using an n-ary
sum, and the arguments of each constructor are represented using
an n-ary product.

This is the development repository. For releases, look on
[Hackage][0].
 
The module [`Generics.SOP`][1] is the main module of this library
and contains more detailed documentation.
 
Examples of using this library are provided by the following
packages:
 
  * [basic-sop][2] basic examples,
  * [pretty-sop][3] generic pretty printing,
  * [lens-sop][4] generically computed lenses,
  * [json-sop][5] generic JSON conversions.
 
A detailed description of the ideas behind this library is provided by
the paper:
 
  * Edsko de Vries and Andres LÃ¶h.
